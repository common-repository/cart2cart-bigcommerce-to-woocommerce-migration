== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I migrate product options to WooCommerce? =
Yes. But keep in mind that due to WooCommerce platform peculiarities, Cart2Cart migrates BigCommerce product options to WooCommerce as product variants. However, by installing a paid [Product Add-Ons](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-add-ons/) on your WooCommerce store prior to data transfer, your product options will be moved directly into the plugin without converting to variants.

= Can I migrate metadata from BigCommerce to WooCommerce? =
Yes, Cart2Cart supports metadata migration between these platforms. You can transfer meta titles, keywords, and descriptions to your new WooCommerce store. In order to do that, you will have to install a free [WordPress SEO Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) before migration.

= How to migrate BigCommerce store manufacturers to WooCommerce? =
Cart2Cart supports the migration of manufacturers from BigCommerce to WooCommerce. However, to enable the migration of manufacturers to your store, you should install the [WooCommerce Brands](https://woocommerce.com/products/brands/) plugin (it's paid).

= Is multilanguage migration to WooCommerce possible? =
Yes, Cart2Cart supports the migration of multiple languages from BigCommerce to WooCommerce provided the paid [WPML module](https://wpml.org/purchase/?aid=152220&affiliate_key=dbnIdBw9K0xa) is purchased & installed on your WordPress before the data transfer (Multilingual CMS).
